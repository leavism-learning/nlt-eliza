One thing I would like to expand upon is that although I think the implementation is rudimentary, I was still able to have a somewhat deep conversation with it. Shown in the attached screenshots, I talked quite a lot about my sister who is a new international student. We did not grow up together as she grew up in Vietnam with my parents while I lived in the US with my grandparents. The questions and responses from Eliza were enough to get my to explore my thoughts and feelings on my relationship with my sister. Regardless of how simple or rudimentary this program is, it can be effective and I'm totally sold on it. I would have continued the conversation with Eliza about my sister but it seemed to have bugged out and just kept repeating what I was saying.
