Use word normalizations to make your chatbot less brittle.  Specifically, use NLTK's stemmer to accept word variations in the user's response.  For example, your chatbot should be able to understand (using normalization/stemming) that 'Can I (*)' and 'Could I (*)' map to the same response pair.  Print to the chatlog the original and the stemmed versions of the user input.  \n\n2. Compute and print the total count of types and the total count of tokens in the stemmed version of user's input from the chatlog (Ignore the chatbot responses for this part.)  Use 10-15 dialogues for this part.  Don't use NLTK's tokenizer.  Implement a simple tokenizer of your own. \nNotes:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports\nPreviously in homework 1 we imported the NLTK `Chat` class which provided the basic implementation of Eliza.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Natural Language Toolkit: Eliza\n#\n# Copyright (C) 2001-2023 NLTK Project\n# Authors: Steven Bird <stevenbird1@gmail.com>\n#          Edward Loper <edloper@gmail.com>\n# URL: <https://www.nltk.org/>\n# For license information, see LICENSE.TXT\n\n# Based on an Eliza implementation by Joe Strout <joe@strout.net>,\n# Jeff Epler <jepler@inetnebr.com> and Jez Higgins <mailto:jez@jezuk.co.uk>.\n\n# a translation table used to convert things you say into things the\n# computer says back, e.g. \"I am\" --> \"you are\"\n\nfrom nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-15T20:09:51.373029Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-15T20:09:51.373379Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.168154Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-15T20:09:51.373354Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.167209Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To improve on this by introducing text normalization, we will have to override some of NLTK's `Chat` functionality.\n\nWe can do this with making a child class that can inherits from `Chat`.\n\nWe will also import a stemmer from NLTK and the regex module.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\nimport re","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.170237Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.170900Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.175180Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.170871Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-15T20:09:53.174223Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will also import the `Defaultdict` container from Python's `collections` module to store our word types when normalizing.\n\nWe are using a `defaultdict` rather than a dictionary because we are expecting unique keys.

One thing I would like to expand upon is that although I think the implementation is rudimentary, I was still able to have a somewhat deep conversation with it. Shown in the attached screenshots, I talked quite a lot about my sister who is a new international student. We did not grow up together as she grew up in Vietnam with my parents while I lived in the US with my grandparents. The questions and responses from Eliza were enough to get my to explore my thoughts and feelings on my relationship with my sister. Regardless of how simple or rudimentary this program is, it can be effective and I'm totally sold on it. I would have continued the conversation with Eliza about my sister but it seemed to have bugged out and just kept repeating what I was saying. ","metadata":{}}]}
